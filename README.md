# This project represents how to connect multiple database to different app.
> This is a project where it is shown how to connect each app to a single database.

Problem I am aware of : 
* The user registration from the admin panel is not possible.
* Custom template and function is required to change password.
* I do think that a form will remove these problems mentioned above.
* No view is present 


The account app proper implementation is can be found in "  [artoction](https://github.com/avinashkkumar/artoction) " which is my Academic Project.

Create virtual environment in the same directory of src of the project and install all the requirement from requirement.txt
